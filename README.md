# CaseShare


## Introduction

### The Project

CaseShare is a social platform that allows healthcare professionals to connect and collaborate.
Doctors and the whole healthcare team experience a lot of things in relation to their responsibilities. They experience 'aha' moments, ecstacy, and sometimes doubt. There are things they wished they knew; things they wish they would do differently if given another chance.
However, many of these experiences stay personal, or local. This is a problem because many healthcare professionals have something to share, but they don't have a platform to do that. As a result, their experiences stay personal, or local within an institution, and other colleagues is different institutions may find themselves reinventing the wheel.
We hereby propose CaseShare, a solution that allows healthcare professionals across different institutions to come together and collaborate. This tool will allow them to connect to each other, ask questions that other colleagues can answer, discuss cases, message each other, and so much more.
CaseShare will enable healthcare practitioners from different institutions to leverage each other’s knowledge, like the way StackOverflow helps developers.
This tool will not support patient transferring, and shall not be used to hold any patient’s data that can be traced back to them. All images shared should be de-identified for patient privacy.
We believe this project is relevant to the development of medicine and quality of care offered in Africa.

### The Context

This is a Portfolio Project concluding 9 months of Foundations in Software Engineering at Holberton School - ALX.
We were tasked to come up with a project we wanted to work on, and went through 3 rounds of reviews by our peers. The MVP was developed in 14 days from 19 May 2023 to 1 June 2023.
